As a visual analytics greenhorn, you are keen to apply newly acquired visual interactivity and visualising uncertainty methods to validate the claims presented above.  


## The Task

In this take-home exercise, you are required to:

-   Select a weather station and download [historical daily temperature or rainfall data](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) from [Meteorological Service Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/home/) website,
-   Select either daily temperature or rainfall records of a month of the year 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2023 and create an analytics-driven data visualisation,
-   Apply appropriate interactive techniques to enhance the user experience in data discovery and/or visual story-telling.

## Submission Instructions

This is an individual assignment. You are required to work on the take-home exercises and prepare submission individually.

The specific submission instructions are as follows:

    -   the data preparation process, 
    -   the selection of data visualisation techniques used, 
    -   and the data visualisation design and interactivity principles and best practices implemented.
