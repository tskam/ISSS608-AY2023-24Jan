## Overview

According to an office report as shown in the infographic below,

-   Daily mean temperature are projected to increase by 1.4 to 4.6, and
-   The contrast between the wet months (November to January) and dry month (February and June to September) is likely to be more pronounced.

As a visual analytics greenhorn, you are keen to apply newly acquired visual interactivity and visualising uncertainty methods to validate the claims presented above.

## The Task

In this take-home exercise, you are required to:

-   Select a weather station and download [historical daily temperature or rainfall data](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) from [Meteorological Service Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/home/) website,
-   Select either daily temperature or rainfall records of a month of the year 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2023 and create an analytics-driven data visualisation,
-   Apply appropriate interactive techniques to enhance the user experience in data discovery and/or visual story-telling.

## Submission Instructions

This is an individual assignment. You are required to work on the take-home exercises and prepare submission individually.

The specific submission instructions are as follows:

-   The analytical visualisation must be prepared by using **R and appropriate R packages**. The report must provide detail discussion and explanation of:
    -   the data preparation process,
    -   the selection of data visualisation techniques used,
    -   and the data visualisation design and interactivity principles and best practices implemented.
-   The write-up of the take-home exercise must be in **Quarto html document** format and publish on **Netlify**.

## Submission date

Your completed take-home exercise is due on **18th February 2024, by 11:59pm evening**.
